# Objects

## Ruby does not use 'primitives'
## Most everything is an object

### Objects are an instance of a Class, a Class is a general type while an Object is a specific instance of that type
### Objects have behaviors that can be complex and interact with each other

# ------------------------ #
# Variables

## Not objects, but keep track of objects and provide a way to reference them while programming
## Once a var is assigned an object, it acts just like that object

# ------------------------ #
# Integer Methods

# 100.Class
# Integer

# 100.next
# 101

# temp = -50
# temp.abs (absolute value)
# 50

# ------------------------ #
# Floats (floating point numbers / decimals)

# price = 12.34
# tax = 0.66
# price + tax
# 13.0 (adding a float to a float returns a float)
